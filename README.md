Language use in human communication is shaped by our goals, our shared experiences, and our understanding of each otherâ€™s abilities, knowledge, and beliefs. At the [**S**ituated **L**anguage and **E**mbodied **D**ialogue (SLED) lab](https://sled.eecs.umich.edu/) (formerly, the [LAIR group](http://lair.cse.msu.edu/)), we develop computational models for language processing that take into account the rich situational and communicative context and build embodied AI agents that can communicate with humans in language.
